# ~~Surftimer-olokos for CS:GO~~

_[We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs) have renamed the repository to ~~Surftimer-olokos~~ just to make it obvious, that we're entering a new chapter in CS:GO surf community, a milestone._
Gimme a good idea to rename this fork.

## Project Goals

As you probably all know there are quite some bugs in all open-source versions of cksurf or surftimer.(yep and in anything beyond 285)
[Our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs) main goal with this project to have a bug-free, properly optimized surf timer that would work as we all expect it to, across ~~all~~ [Our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs) configuration~~s~~.
Because of this, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs) will be putting new features and additions on the side, as they can potentially introduce new, unknown issues and there's plenty of those already.(no shit)

**Does it mean this version is buggy?**

Yes

**Pull requests and any contributions are (not) welcome ~~and encouraged!~~ (if you wanna contribute go there and help those poor souls https://github.com/surftimer/Surftimer-olokos)**
